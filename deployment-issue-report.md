# Deployment Issue Report: S3 Bucket Mismatch

## Issue Summary
The GitHub Actions deployment workflow is successfully running but deploying to the wrong S3 bucket. This prevents new features from appearing on the live site at https://facecontrolgame.com.

## Problem Details

### Current Situation
- **Symptom**: New code changes (Elder Portal button, Gary's new features) are not appearing on the live site
- **Root Cause**: The `S3_BUCKET` GitHub secret is set to an incorrect value
- **Impact**: All deployments since April 2025 have not reached the production site

### Evidence
1. **File Age**: Live site files are dated April 24, 2025
   ```
   last-modified: Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:34:18 GMT
   ```

2. **File Size Mismatch**:
   - Local `app.js`: 1,589 lines
   - Live `app.js`: 867 lines

3. **Missing Features**:
   - No Elder Portal button in HTML
   - No Gary scanner ducky code
   - No space jail functionality

4. **Deployment Logs**: Show successful uploads but to wrong bucket (masked as `***` in logs)

## Configuration Requirements

### Correct Values (from README.md)
- **S3 Bucket**: `facecontrolgame.com`
- **CloudFront Distribution ID**: `E15E4MBKLEWK2U`

### Current Infrastructure
- CloudFront serves from: `facecontrolgame.com` S3 bucket
- GitHub Actions deploys to: Unknown bucket (incorrect value in secrets)

## Solution Steps

1. **Update GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/toddllm/face-controls/settings/secrets/actions
   - Update `S3_BUCKET` to: `facecontrolgame.com`
   - Verify `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` is: `E15E4MBKLEWK2U`

2. **Trigger Deployment**:
   - Either push a new commit
   - Or manually trigger the "Deploy to S3 and CloudFront" workflow

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check https://facecontrolgame.com for the Elder Portal button
   - Verify file dates are current

## Features Waiting to Deploy

Once the S3 bucket is corrected, these features will go live:

1. **Elder Portal Button**: Purple button to summon Gary at any time
2. **Gary's Scanner Ducky**: Threat detection companion
3. **Space Jail**: Monster trap with remote control
4. **Item System**: Gary can hold remotes, crystals, scanners
5. **Ship Flying**: Gary can pilot spaceships
6. **Voice Lines**: Contextual dialogue system

## Prevention
Consider adding a deployment verification step to the GitHub Actions workflow that checks if files were actually updated on the live site.
